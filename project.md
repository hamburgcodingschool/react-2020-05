# Project: Travel Blog in React

This project is part of the curriculum of the Full-Stack Web Development program at [Hamburg Coding School](https://hamburgcodingschool.com/).

## Goal

Goal is to transfer the main idea from your last [project "The Travel Blog"](https://github.com/hamburgcodingschool/javascript-for-web-2020-03/blob/master/PROJECT.md),
made with pure Javascript, HTML and CSS into a **React App**.

While working on the project remind yourself of *"thinking in components"*, â€“ one of the many great parts of React.

## Features

### 1. Dashboard (Main Page)

The dashboard shows an overview of the all blog posts and a Google Map.
- Left: Blog Post preview cards
- Right: Google Map with markers at the positions of the blog posts

### 2. Menu Bar
- Add a menu bar which contains a logo (of your choice) and the Headline (a name of your choice) on the left side.
- In the menu provide a login button (text + icon) on the right side.
- The menu bar is available on all pages.

> **Icon Resources:** We recommend you use [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/) for your icons.

### 3. Authentication / Login
- Use Firebase Auth (login with email and password) for authentication.
- If the login button is clicked, a login form is shown right below the login button under the menu bar.
- The User can login with her email and password.
- If successfully logged in, the login form disappears and instead of the login button a logout button is shown.
- If logged in, there should be another button for adding a new blog post (icon + text: "New blog post") on the left of the logout button. It links to `/new`, where the logged-in user can add a new blog post.

### 4. World Map with Google Maps API

- Use the [google-map-react](https://github.com/google-map-react/google-map-react) library to display a world map.
- For each blog post, put a marker on the map at the location of the post.
- Initially the map gets centered by the newest blog post entry.

#### Display Blog Posts at Location

- Make the markers clickable: on click, show the short preview of the blog post in the "InfoWindow".
- It contains:
  - title
  - visiting date
  - authors image and name (can be hardcoded)
  - Place a link, which links to the detail page: `/post/:id`
  - The InfoWindow can be closed by clicking on the "x" (which is placed at right-top in the InfoWindow

### 5. Blog Posts

#### Get Blog Posts from Firestore

- Store the blog posts on Firebase Firestore and load them with the Firebase API.
- Also save the coordinates of a location with latitude and longitude.
- Load all blog posts on the dashboard (main) page.
- The blog post previews should be visible on the left, right beside the map.

#### Blog Post Previews

- On the left all blog posts are listed as previews (similar to the Micro Blog from JavaScript for Web).
- The blogs are ordered ascending by visiting date.
- Each preview contains:
  - title
  - visiting date
  - authors image + name (can be hardcoded)
  - image
  - When user clicks on one of the listed blog post than she gets linked to the detail page `/post/:id`

![Preview](/img/blog-post-preview.jpg)

#### Blog Post Detail
- On clicking at the title or the image of the blog post preview, the blog post is opened at the detail page `/post/:id`.
- A back button at the details page (position: top-left) links back to the dashboard.
- The detail page shows the full blog post, with all information.

**Content of a blog post**  
A blog post should contain:
  - title
  - visiting date
  - authors name
  - image
  - text
  - location with city and country

### 6. New Blog Post

- With the path `/new` a blog post form is shown, where a new blog post can be added.
- On submit, the new blog post is sent and stored to Firestore.
- The form is cleared after adding a new blog post and the user gets directed to the Dashboard, again.  

  You can use the history hook provided by the React Router: `useHistory()`.

  ```
  import { useHistory } from "react-router-dom";

  function HomeButton() {
    let history = useHistory();

    function handleClick() {
      history.push("/home");
    }

    return (
      <button type="button" onClick={handleClick}>
        Go home
      </button>
    );
  }
  ```
  You can read more about, how changing a route programmatically, here:
  
  - https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/api/Hooks/usehistory
  - https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/api/history

- For the images: Save the image in your project manually in the public folder and use it with relative path as string.  
  For instance: The image `barcelona.jpg` saved under `public/images` can be linked in the templates with `"/images/barcelona.jpg"`.
- Only signed in user can add new blog posts.

## Submission

1. Upload your code to a new GitHub repository.
  - If you placed your API keys directly into your code, remember to remove your API keys.

    **Hint:**
    There is a way to use keys in the React project without the risk to push those to a repository accidentally:
      - Add a file `.env` into your project root folder. It is ignored by git.
      - In this file you can define custom environment variables like that: `REACT_APP_MY_API_KEY=MyKey-12345`
      - Within your component you can use it with `{process.env.REACT_APP_MY_API_KEY}`
      - After every change in this files you have to restart your project.

      For more information check out: https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-custom-environment-variables/.

  - If you worked in a team, link the GitHub accounts of both of you in the README.md.

2. Send us an email with the following information:
  - A link to your GitHub repository
  - Your firebase configuration and
  - Please create a guest user account in firebase for us which we can use to log in to your travel blog app. Send us the credentials (email + password) for this guest login.
  - If you worked in a team, both your names
  - If you did any bonus tasks, list them
  - Send it to Mary (mary@hamburgcodingschool.com) and Teresa (teresa@hamburgcodingschool.com)
