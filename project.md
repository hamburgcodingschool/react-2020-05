## Project: Travel Blog in React

This project is part of the curriculum of the Full-Stack Web Development program at [Hamburg Coding School](https://hamburgcodingschool.com/).

### Goal

Goal is to transfer the main idea from your last [project "The Travel Blog"](https://github.com/hamburgcodingschool/javascript-for-web-2020-03/blob/master/PROJECT.md),
made with pure Javascript, HTML and CSS into a **React App**.

While working on the project remind yourself of *"thinking in components"*, â€“ one of the many great parts of React.

### Features

#### Dashboard (Main Page)

The dashboard shows an overview of the all blog posts and a contains a map aside, there all blog posts location are marked.

### Menu Bar
- Add a menu which contains the logo and the "Blog Post" Headline on the left side.

- If clicked on the login button, a login form is shown right below the login button under the menu.

- Also: Right beside the login button another button (icon + text) for creating new a blog post appears, if the user is logged in.
It links to '/new', where logged in users can add new blog posts.

### Optional Bonus Tasks

### Submission

1. Upload your code to a new GitHub repository.
  - If you placed your API keys directly into your code, remember to remove your API keys.

    **Hint:**
    There is a way to use keys in the React project without the risk to push those to a repository accidentally:
      - Add a file `.env` into your project root folder. It is ignored by git.
      - In this file you can define custom environment variables like that: `REACT_APP_MY_API_KEY=MyKey-12345`
      - Within your component you can use it with `{process.env.REACT_APP_MY_API_KEY}`
      - After every change in this files you have to restart your project.

      For more information check out: https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-custom-environment-variables/.



  - If you worked in a team, link the GitHub accounts of both of you in the README.md.

2. Send us an email with the following information:
  - A link to your GitHub repository
  - If you worked in a team, both your names
  - If you did any bonus tasks, list them
  - Send it to Mary (mary@hamburgcodingschool.com) and Teresa (teresa@hamburgcodingschool.com)
